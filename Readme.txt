How to run:
Open the Visual Studio Solution labelled ‘Airport Simulator’ and the solution labelled ‘Plane Logger’. Once these two projects are open in Visual Studio 
you will need to compile them both. One application displaying the Simulation and the other displaying the Logger. The Logger has no interaction
functionality as it only displays information about the Airport. With the Simulator you start with a plane in each of the three hubs and these hubs
have a button next to them which will send the planes to the runway to take off. In the bottom right of the Airport is the arrival hub, containing the
next plane to arrive at the Airport. You can select a destination for this arriving plane by using the radio buttons next to it. 0 is for the plane 
to land and take off and the other three send the plane to the chosen hub.
